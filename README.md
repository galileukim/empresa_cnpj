# Objective:
Use the Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jur√≠dica (BRA), a registry of all created and extinct companies in Brazil, to analyze inter alia the following queries:

1) How likely are companies to donate to candidates comprising their boards?
2) Do religious parties create more religious institutions in municipalities in which they gain power?
3) Do companies that sponsor local candidates gain better access to funding/growth?

This is an ongoing project that will require several collaborators. If you are excited to join this, please let me know!
